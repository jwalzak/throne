		<p><img src="./Images/VlambeerGrey.png" alt="vlambeer logo" /> Nuclear Throne is an action game with rogue-like elments brought to you by Vlambeer a Dutch independent game maker. The game itself focuses on action rather than story, in fact I'm pretty sure the story planning phase has not gone past the planning part.</p>

		<p>One of the trademarks of Vlambeer games is screenshake. When you fire your weapon, when anything explodes the screen will shake violently.</p>
		
		<p>The game has a high difficulty and is filled with action. There are 12 playable characters with some <span>secret</span> characters in the mix as well. There are five different weapon types each weapon has different variations making an impressive 95 different weapons available. All the levels are randomly generated making each playthrough different than the last.</p>

		<p>Nuclear Throne was put onto Steam Early Access in October of 2013 and was released in December of 2015. Vlambeer still plans on updating the game and the proper release was "just a formatilty".</p>

		<p>Originally the game was going to be called Wasteland Kings, but they decided to change the name after a cordail email from another game development company who was making the game Wastelend 2. Nuclear throne was decided as a better name anyway as it was considered more gender inclusive.</p>

		<p>One of the most popular parts of Nuclear Throne is the daily and weekly runs. Since the levels are randomly generated Vlambeer have set up runs that are the same for every player. The daily run you are only able to play once and your score is put on the leaderboard for everyone to see. The weekly runs are done every weekend. Usually a member of the community is suggests an opening character and loadout.</p>
